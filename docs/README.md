# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for matematisk!

Here you can find the documentation for matematisk, everything from its project goals, design, and planned features, to compiler architecture, IR, and other important things.

- [Project](Project.md)
- [Roadmap](Roadmap.md)

Documentation for matematisk is heavily needed! The current standard is to document using Markdown files, but there are plans to review the documentation tooling to allow it to scale outside of this repository! The crates are also in need of internal documentation.
